Wheel Mobile Robot Base Documentation
===================================================

Hi!

This website serves as a documentation for the wheel mobile robot base used for agricultural terrain navigation. For anyone that would like to continue using the robot for their final year project or research projects, this website shall guide you on your development needs including mechanical, electrical and electronics, and software aspects

You can find all sorts of details of the robot base including mechanical drawings, schematic diagrams, data flow diagrams and so on

If you would like to become the site maintainer, do contact me at: ooisoojack333@gmail.com
